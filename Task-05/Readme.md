# 🖥️🌐 TerminalTrolly 🖥️🌐

This was one of my favourites too. Escpecially making a website that functions with custom terminal. At first I thought it wasn't possible, but soon after referring to certain documentation on [FAKE STORE API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) I managed to understand its format and how the details of each item can be transferred.

This was an outstanding project I managed to conquer throughly.
