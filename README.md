# amfoss-tasks

## INTRODUCTION
Hello everyone<br>
I'm Sidharth sunil, currently a second-year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering (CSE) with a focus on AI .Well first of all I am bio-student and have no experience in coding. Although I still am very passionate towars building a computational environment which would benefit the socirty.
So as of now I am starting from scratch and moving to the top so that I can develop my skills.

## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I've known to code for a while, and I've always liked solving problems I couldn't complete some, but I never stopped trying to grow better. What drives me, even more, is the need to learn how something or anything works. Today's world AI keeps on developing and reaching to new heights. I think amfoss will allow me to understand the world we live in today. I believe that after I improve my skills and become a professional programmer I will do my level to tackle any problems provided by  your group.
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Becoming better at coding in general. I realized I was still lacking a ton of information regarding the concept of CSE. For the next 6 - months I plan onto create a schedule to level and discover certain resources which would benefit my crtitical algorithm mindset.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything. Even if it is just helping with some event or doing a project, I am ready to give my blood and sweat to this club. And also enjoy thw work as a family.
### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
I found some of the tasks hard, but that is what I expected, and the tasks were stellarly delivered the reason why this club is one of the best student clubs in the nation. I learned a lot of new things in just a month and that too in different fields and different languages. From making a simple mobile app to client-server and web scrapping, it has been fun as much as it has been infuriating sometimes. I found the whole procedure to be perfect.
