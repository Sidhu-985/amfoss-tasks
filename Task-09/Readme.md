# Hero-dex

This took me almost two weeks but its done. I added all the necessary assets to create the required App with certain funcionalities using certain widgets.<br> **Note:**<br> There are some dependencies are requied to be added in your pubspec.yaml file in order to get the changes.

Ensure that your pubspec.yaml contains these assets,fonts and dependencies:
## Google Fonts in dependencies
![Google Fonts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca713158-acf7-499a-93bf-7d2875d78553)

## Fonts and assets

Then update it to get these changes so that the app runs effeciently.
