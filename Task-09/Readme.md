# Hero-dex

This took me almost two weeks but its done. I added all the necessary assets to create the required App with certain funcionalities using certain widgets.<br> **Note:**<br> There are some dependencies are requied to be added in your pubspec.yaml file in order to get the changes.

Ensure that your pubspec.yaml contains these assets,fonts and dependencies:
- flutter:
- assets:
  - assets/superhero.json
  -   fonts:
      - family:MyFlutterApp
      -  fonts:
         - asset: fonts/MyFlutterApp.ttf

- dependencies:
  - google_fonts: ^6.2.1

Then update it to get these changes so that the app runs effeciently.
